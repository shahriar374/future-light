The team swiftly captured the chemical profiles of coastal environments and highlighted potential sources of pollution.\r\n\r\n\"We are interested in understanding how such pollutants get introduced in the ecosystem,\" said Daniel Petras, an assistant professor of biochemistry at UC Riverside, who led the research team. \"Figuring out which molecules in the ocean are important for environmental health is not straightforward because of the ocean\'s sheer chemical diversity. The protocol we developed greatly speeds up this process. More efficient sorting of the data means we can understand problems related to ocean pollution faster.\"\r\n\r\nPetras and his colleagues report in the journal Nature Protocols that their protocol is designed not only for experienced researchers but also for educational purposes, making it an ideal resource for students and early-career scientists. This computational workflow is accompanied by an accessible web application with a graphical user interface that makes metabolomics data analysis accessible for non-experts and enables them to gain statistical insights into their data within minutes.','New data science tool greatly speeds up molecular analysis of our environment','admin'),(10,'a577172e-a0a8-4380-b2f7-b92a1c4f28f6_dna.png','Researchers have reconstructed the oldest human genomes ever found in South Africa from two people who lived around 10,000 years ago, allowing a better understanding of how the region was populated, an author of the study said Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe genetic sequences were from a man and a woman whose remains were found at a rock shelter near the southern coastal town of George, about 370 kilometers (230 miles) east of Cape Town, said University of Cape Town (UCT) biological anthropology professor Victoria Gibbon.\r\n\r\nThey were among 13 sequences reconstructed from people whose remains were found at the Oakhurst shelter and lived 1,300-10,000 years ago. Prior to these discoveries, the oldest genomes reconstructed from the region dated back around 2,000 years.\r\n\r\nA surprise finding from the Oakhurst study was that the oldest genomes were genetically similar to those from San and Khoekhoe groups living in the same region today, UCT said in a statement.\r\n\r\n\"Similar studies from Europe have revealed a history of large-scale genetic changes due to human movements over the last 10,000 years,\" said lead author of the study, Joscha Gretzinger, in the statement.\r\n\r\n\"These new results from southernmost Africa are quite different, and suggest a long history of relative genetic stability,\" said Gretzinger, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, which participated in the study.\r\n\r\nDNA data currently show this only changed around 1,200 years ago when newcomers arrived and introduced pastoralism, agriculture and new languages to the region, and began interacting with local hunter-gatherer groups.\r\n\r\nEven though some of the world\'s earliest evidence of modern humans can be traced to southern Africa, it tends to be poorly preserved, Gibbon told AFP. Newer technology made it possible to obtain this DNA, she said.\r\n\r\nUnlike in Europe and Asia where the genomes of thousands of people have been reconstructed, fewer than two dozen ancient genomes have been recovered from southern Africa, specifically Botswana, South Africa and Zambia.\r\n\r\n\"Sites like this are rare in South Africa, and Oakhurst has allowed for a better understanding of local population movements and relationships across the landscape over nearly 9,000 years,\" Gibbon said.','Researchers decode oldest human DNA from South Africa to date','shahriar123');
